# llama-70b-chat-4-shards

This repository contains a script to transform the weights of Llama v2 70B (chat)/Llama v3 70B (chat) from an 8-shard configuration to a 4-shard configuration, making it more accessible for users with machines that have only 4 GPUs.

For convenience, you can directly download weights from https://huggingface.co/Jinawei/llama-v2-70b-chat-4-shards

## Introduction

Meta recently released the weights for Llama v2 70B/Llama v3 70B, distributed across 8 shards. However, some users may have hardware constraints, such as having only 4 GPUs on their machine, making it difficult to load and utilize the model directly. This repository provides a solution to this problem by offering a script that can transform the 8-shard weight distribution of LLAMA v2 70B/Llama v3 70B or into a 4-shard configuration, facilitating easier usage on machines with fewer GPUs.

## Usage

You can convert weights of Llama v2 using the command below:
```
python convert.py \
    --input_llama_path ~/llama-2-70b-chat \
    --input_shards 8 \
    --output_llama_path ~/llama-2-70b-chat-4-shards \
    --output_shards 4
    --llama_version 2
```

You can convert weights of Llama v3 using the command below:
```
python convert.py \
    --input_llama_path ~/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct \
    --input_shards 8 \
    --output_llama_path ~/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-1-shards \
    --output_shards 4
    --llama_version 3
```
